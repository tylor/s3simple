s3simple - an Amazon filesystem for Linux

This is an implementation of an Amazon S3 filesystem for Linux with minimal dependencies. Currently it only depends on libcurl.

** The code in this repository is highly experiemental but is a good example of a simple filesystem.

Created as a term project while studying at the University of British Columbia.
