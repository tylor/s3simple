s3simple - an Amazon filesystem for Linux

This is an implementation of an Amazon S3 filesystem for Linux with minimal dependencies. Currently it only depends on libcurl.

** The code in this repository is highly experiemental but is a good example of a simple filesystem.

Quick build and test instructions:

$ make
$ sudo su
# insmod s3simple.ko
# ./s3simple & # run s3simple in the background
# mount -t s3simple /dev/zero /mnt/ # mount virtual device on /mnt
# cat /mnt/hello.txt # take a look at the file's contents
# umount /mnt/
# ps # to get the [pid] of s3simple
# kill [pid] # shut down s3simple
# rmmod s3simple
# exit
$ make clean # to clean up the compiled files


Created as a term project while studying at the University of British Columbia.
